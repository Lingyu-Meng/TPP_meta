6,Intergroup bias influences third-party punishment and compensation: In-group relationships attenuate altruistic punishment,1,Lab,Natural ,Stiudent Association,Participants were assigned based on their real student association membership (in-group vs out-group),163,Undergraduates,65,98,18.79,0.87,Chinese,China,Dictator Game,"Before starting the experiment, participants were asked to play the game with two other players who had completed a task earlier that allowed them to jointly earn 50 monetary units (MU), each of which was valued at RMB 0.1 (USD 1.51 cents). One of the two players would be randomly chosen to act as the dictator/proposer (Player A) and the other would act as the recipient (Player B). Player A would then choose how to divide the 50 MU between him-/herself and Player B, and the latter player had to accept the decision. Furthermore, participants were told that in each trial they would be informed of the group affiliation of each player. There were four grouping configurations in the experiment: A was in-group and B was in-group (IN–IN), A was in-group and B was out-group (IN–OUT), A was out-group and B was in-group (OUT–IN), and A was out-group and B was out-group (OUT–OUT). Participants were then told that they would be endowed with 20 MU that they could decide to keep and accrue over the game, or invest to punish Player A or compensate Player B. If participants chose to punish or compensate, they were further asked to choose from six fixed-choice amounts how much they would invest: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18 MU. Transferred MU were afforded a multiplier effect: If participants chose to punish, for each MU, Player A’s payoff would decrease by 3 MU; if they chose to compensate, Player B’s payoff would increase by 3 MU. Participants were informed that they would be paid according to their choices made in several randomly chosen rounds of the game, as well as receiving an additional payment of RMB 20 for participating in the study. All participants completed 72 trials. In each group constellation, there were three fair trials (i.e., the dictator proposed a 50:50 allocation) and 15 unfair trials, comprising three trials each wherein dictators proposed unbalanced distributions of 30:20, 35:15, 40:10, 45:5, and 50:0.",Deception,Not Reported,No,Not Reported,1,50,0,Punish or Compensate,20,3,18,3,3,18,3,Token,0.1,CNY,Yes,Within,Yes,Within,Yes,Within,"30:20, 35:15, 40:10, 45:5, and 50:0",No,NA,,,,Unfair,,Ingroup,Ingroup,163,15,2445,,467,7.24,6.664,,1350,10.407,4.596,,628,,
